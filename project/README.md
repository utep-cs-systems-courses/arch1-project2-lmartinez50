To compile this program use make all, then use make load to load the program
into the MSP430

On this project I programmed a MSP430 to simulate a piano toy. The program
turn leds on/off, and make sounds with the buzzer by using the buttons on the
MSP430. Also I use the lcd display to display some cool messages and an image.

I use the four buttons from the MSP430 on Port 2 to play a note of a different
song.

Button S1 plays notes from La Bamba song by Los Lobos.
Button S2 plays notes from Star Wars theme song.
Button S3 plays notes from La Cucaracha song
Button S4 stop the program and turn on and then dimming the red led indicating that the toy is "off".
